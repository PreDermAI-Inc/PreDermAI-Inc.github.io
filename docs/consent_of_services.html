It also explains how your information and sample(s) will be used after performance of the Services. Your sample(s) will not be processed unless you confirm that you have read and understood the contents of this form.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c6">By clicking on the box when registering on the iuno mobile app,</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;you indicate that this Consent is a binding agreement and that you have read and understood the following terms. Capitalized terms used but not defined in this Consent have the meaning given to them in our other policies.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c1">By clicking your acceptance, you have chosen to use our Services and have given your informed consent to have your biological sample(s) collected, and if you choose to purchase a subscription, tested for proteins and/or genes. Biological samples shall consist solely of human fluids that are intended to be analyzed for the individual&rsquo;s sole use, and not for any other purpose, including but not limited to research, publications, commercial uses, or any other purpose other than to inform the purchaser&rsquo;s health and/or wellness.</span></p><p class="c5"><span class="c0">Voluntary Participation</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c1">Our Services are offered and available to users who are residents of the United States. Your use of PreDermAI&rsquo;s Services is voluntary. It is your choice whether to utilize our Services or not. Prior to signing this Consent, you may wish to speak with your healthcare provider for further guidance.</span></p><p class="c5"><span class="c0">Procedures and Protocol for PreDermAI Tests</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c1">When you create your Account, we will collect some information from you. We cannot perform the Services without collecting information from you but we will only collect information that will assist us in providing the Services that you have requested. In order for the Services to be provided as intended, you must provide accurate and correct information. Failure to provide required information or to execute required documents may result in your sample(s) not being tested.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c8">You will collect the biological sample(s) (i.e., blood) and you will send the sample(s) to us, and if you purchase a subscription, we will send the sample(s) to our designated testing laboratory partners (&ldquo; Lab&rdquo;) where your sample(s) will be tested for a number of proteins </span><span class="c1 c11">and genes that may inform your health and wellness choices.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c1">The results of your test(s) may be made available to you through our Services. In the event we determine that a biological sample is not suitable for testing due to the content of the sample or because we believe the sample to have been submitted in violation of this Consent or the User Agreement, we reserve the right to withhold the results. We will determine and establish normal ranges for all tests in conjunction with the Labs based on their validation and proficiency testing procedures. </span></p><p class="c5"><span class="c0">Risks</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c1">In order to utilize our Services, you must collect the appropriate biological sample(s) for the test(s). Our tests require the collection of a blood sample. Although the risks and discomforts associated with a finger prick blood draw are very low, you might be at risk for excessive bleeding, fainting, feeling light-headed, bruising, hematoma (blood accumulating under the skin), or infection (a slight risk any time the skin is broken). If you have a history of excessive bleeding or fainting while having blood work done, we advise avoiding our tests as they require self-collection of a blood sample.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c1">Disclosing certain information may make you uncomfortable. Our Services include protein tests that may reveal sensitive information about your health. This information may be distressing.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c1">Health information that you choose to share with your physician or other healthcare providers may become part of your medical record and through that route may be accessible to other healthcare providers and/or insurance companies in the future. Information that you share with family, friends or employers may also be used against your interests. Even if you share health information that has no or limited meaning today, that information could have greater meaning in the future as new discoveries are made.</span></p><p class="c5"><span class="c0">Limitations</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c1">OUR SERVICES DO NOT PROVIDE MEDICAL ADVICE.
