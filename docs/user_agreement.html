To this effect, the Parties shall consult and negotiate with each other in good faith and, recognizing their mutual interests, attempt to reach a just and equitable solution satisfactory to both Parties. If the Parties do not reach such solution within a period of thirty (30) days, then all disputes shall be resolved by binding arbitration in Santa Clara, California, in accordance with the Commercial Arbitration Rules of the American Arbitration Association (the &ldquo;AAA&rdquo;), subject to the limitations of this section. This agreement to arbitrate will be specifically enforceable in any court having jurisdiction. Notice of a demand for arbitration shall be filed in writing with the other party hereto and with the AAA. The demand for arbitration shall be made within a reasonable time after the dispute has arisen, and in no event shall any such demand be made after the date when institution of legal or equitable proceedings based on such dispute would be barred by the applicable statute of limitations. The Parties agree that one (1) arbitrator shall arbitrate the dispute. The arbitrator shall be selected by the joint agreement of the Parties, but if they do not so agree within twenty (20) days after the date of the notice of a demand for arbitration referred to above, the selection shall be made pursuant to the Commercial Arbitration Rules of the AAA from the panels of business arbitrators maintained by the AAA. The Parties agree that the arbitrator shall have sole authority to decide whether claims brought by either party (excluding claims brought under Section 21 below) are subject to this dispute resolution agreement. The decision of the arbitrator shall be made in writing, shall be final, judgment may be entered upon it in any court having jurisdiction thereof, and the decision shall not be subject to vacation, modification or appeal, except to the extent permitted by sections 10 and 11 of the Federal Arbitration Act, the terms of which sections the Parties agree shall apply. The fees charged by the AAA and arbitrator shall be shared equally by the parties.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Governing Law.&nbsp;</span><span class="c1">All disputes arising out of or relating to the User Agreement shall be governed by California law regardless of where you access the Site or the Services, and notwithstanding any conflicts of law principles.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Preliminary Equitable Relief and Intellectual Property Claims.&nbsp;</span><span class="c1">Either party to this User Agreement may bring a claim related to intellectual property rights, or seek temporary or preliminary specific performance or temporary or preliminary injunctive relief, in any court of competent jurisdiction, without the posting of bond or other security.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Miscellaneous.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Class Action Waiver.&nbsp;</span><span class="c1">Any proceedings to resolve or litigate any dispute in any forum will be conducted solely on an individual basis.
